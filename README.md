Dev Config
==========

To Use: 
Install git then from `$HOME` run:
```
git clone https://github.com/mlundyCO/dev_config
chmod u+x /dev_config/setup.sh
./dev_config/setup.sh
```
You need `sudo` priviledge to install `zsh`, `tmux`, and `neovim`, but otherwise you only need the user's password to change the shell.
A new `zsh` login shell will be created.
