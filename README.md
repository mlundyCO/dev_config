vim and zsh
===========

My vim and zsh config files.

To Use: 
First make sure zsh, vim, and git are installed then from /home/[user] run:

    git clone https://github.com/mlundyCO/vim_zsh_config
    ln -s /home/[user]/vim/vimrc /home/[user]/.vimrc
    ln -s /home/[user]/vim/zshrc /home/[user]/.zshrc

Then run "chsh" and point to /bin/zsh, then logout and log back in.
